Forked `nipy.labs.datasets` subpackage
--------------------------------------

This is a static fork of the `nipy.labs.datasets` package. It contains a few pieces of `nipy` that are used in `moss`. It exists because as of May 2014 there are some compilation issues with nipy that make it hard to use. When those are resolved, this package can be jettisoned and a dependency on `nipy` can be added back to `moss`.
